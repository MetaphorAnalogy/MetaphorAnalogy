Hi, I’m Daria! 👩‍🔬

I’m a molecular biologist on a mission to turn my fascination with genomics and microbiology into meaningful insights through data to make sense of life’s tiniest mysteries. 🧬🔍

Right now, I’m learning one script at a time, fueled by curiosity and determination. I’m diving into Python and data analysis, wrangling biological datasets, and exploring ways to bridge science and tech. 
When I’m not elbow-deep in code or sequencing data, you might find me sharing science stories, pondering ethics in AI, or looking at bacteria 🦠.
If you’re into biology, data, or just quirky ideas, let’s connect. Who knows - we might just make something awesome! 🚀
